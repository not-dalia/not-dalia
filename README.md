## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a Research Software Engineer with a curiosity for creative coding.**

- ðŸ”¬ Creating digital research tools at [NorSC](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-and-information-sciences/research/northumbria-social-computing/)
- ðŸŽ¨ Experimenting with code as a creative medium


Sometimes I tinker with things like:
- Interactive data visualizations
- Web-based audio experiments
- Text and language processing tools

See more of what I've been up to on [my personal website](https://relevant.space/).
