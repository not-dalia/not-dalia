# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dalya. I also go by Dalia. Here's a little bit about me:

- Research Software Engineer currently working at [NorSC](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-and-information-sciences/research/northumbria-social-computing/). 
- Curious about creative coding, interactive data visualization, and creating tiny tools for just about anything
- See more of what I've been up to on [my personal website](https://relevant.space/).
